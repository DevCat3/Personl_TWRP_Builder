## 📋 How to Use

Running a Build

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Actions → TWRP Recovery Builder - Personalized
3. Click Run workflow
4. Fill in the form:
   - TWRP Version: Select from dropdown (e.g., `3.7.0_twrp-11.0`)
   - Device Tree: Your device tree URL
   - Device Tree Branch: Branch name (e.g., `android-11.0`)
   - Device Path: Path format (e.g., `device/samsung/gta4lve`)
   - Device Name: Device codename (e.g., `gta4lve`)
   - Build Target: `recovery`, `boot`, or `vendorboot`
   - (Optional) Create Samsung TAR: Check if building for Samsung device

5. Click Run workflow

Build Duration

- First build: 30-60 minutes (downloads 50GB source code)
- Subsequent builds: 15-30 minutes (uses cached sources)

---

## 📁 Required Device Tree Structure

Your device tree must contain one of these makefiles:

```
device/<brand>/<codename>/
├── twrp_<codename>.mk         # Preferred for AOSP-based TWRP
├── omni_<codename>.mk          # Alternative for older versions
└── AndroidProducts.mk         # Should reference the above
```

---

## 📤 Outputs

After successful build, the workflow creates a GitHub Release with:

File	Description	
`<target>.img`	The recovery/boot/vendor_boot image	
`recovery.zip`	ZIP containing the image file	
`<target>.tar`	(Samsung only) Odin-flashable TAR package	

Release Information Includes:
- TWRP Version & Android version
- Device tree commit hash
- MD5 checksum for verification
- Build date and device information

## 🔧 Configuration Options

TWRP Version Mapping

User Selection	Actual Manifest Branch	Android Version	
`3.7.1_twrp-12.1`	`twrp-12.1`	Android 12.1	
`3.7.0_twrp-11.0`	`twrp-11`	Android 11	
`3.6.2_twrp-11.0`	`twrp-11`	Android 11	
`3.6.1_twrp-10.0`	`twrp-10`	Android 10	
`3.5.x_twrp-9.0`	`twrp-9`	Android 9	

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

Manifest Sync Error

If you see `couldn't find remote ref`, the branch name is incorrect. The workflow automatically maps:
- `twrp-11.0` → `twrp-11`
- `twrp-10.0` → `twrp-10`
- `twrp-9.0` → `twrp-9`

## Build Failures

- Missing Dependencies: Check `LDCHECK` path in device tree
- Python Errors: For Android 9-10, Python 2 is auto-installed
- Memory Issues: Build uses 24GB swap space by default

Permission Errors

Ensure your GitHub token has `contents: write` permission for releases.
